Tensors and polynomials play an important role in theoretical computer science and, in particular, in the area of algebraic complexity theory. We refer to \cite{BCS97} for a comprehensive overview of the subject, to \cite{Sap21} for a more modern introduction, and to \cite{Lan17} and \cite{BI18} for the overview of geometric methods in this area, the former from a geometric point of view and the latter more from the point of view of computer science.
