Tensors and polynomials play an important role in theoretical computer science and in particular in the area of algebraic complexity theory. We refer to \cite{BCS97} for a complete introduction on the subject, and to \cite{Lan17} and \cite{BI18} for the use of geometric methods in this area, from a geometric point of view and a more computer science point of view, respectively.
